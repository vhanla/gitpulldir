This is just a simple cli tool for Windows to do a `git pull` in each subdirectoy of the current directory which qualifies as a git repository, but for now just checks if it has a `.git` directory inside.

It lists them and proceeds to execute each asking for prompt:
y = yes
n = bypass, continues to the next in queue
a = all of them, bypass prompts
q = cancel

at the end it shows a list of failed `git pull` calls.
